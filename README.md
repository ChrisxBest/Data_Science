# This repo contains machine learning models and projects and is mainly based on supervised learning.
# The focus is set on regression algorithms
2. The focus is set on classification algorithms

In addition to that, outlier detection as part of EDA is beeing added. 

Unsupervised learning like clustering and dimensionality reduction will be added soon.

ML-Multiple linear regression:
1. The data points are independent of each other
2. There is a linear relationship between the feature and the target
3. The residuals are normally distributed
4. The residuals have constant variance
5. The features are independent of each other

Workflow:
1. Select model type
2. Instantiate model with specific hyperparameters
3. Split data into feature matrix and target vector
4. Fit model to data (model fitting)
5. Make predictions with trained model
